# Implementation of Ruby `strscan` module

This gems implements the `StringScanner` class from the `strscan.rb` Ruby standard library for use with RubyMotion.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-strscan'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install motion-strscan

## Implementation details

This is a pure Ruby implementation of `StringScanner` (no Cocoa apis), borrowed from the MacRuby project, with some minor modifications to handle multibyte strings correctly.

**Note:**  While Ruby uses the Oniguruma regular expression library, RubyMotion uses the ICU library on iOS/OSX, and the Java library on Andriod.  There are minor differences, particularly in the handling of `^` 

For example, ICU will match a `^` only at the beginning of the input,Â unless you add the `m` flag; then it will match the beginning of the line as well. In Oniguruma, `^` matches the beginning of the line by default.

So if you're porting a Ruby libary that uses regular expressions, you need to be aware of these differences.

### Supported Platforms

Bot iOS and OS X are supported targets.  Will accept contibutions for Andriod support
